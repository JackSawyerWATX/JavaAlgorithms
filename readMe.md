Several Java algos are covered here.

In order as they are in the code:
    1. Building a, array of random numbers
    2. Building the size of the array and how to return it
    3. Getting the value of an index in the array
    4. Finding a value in the array
    5. Deleting an index in the array
    6. Inserting a value into the array
    7. Searching for a value in the array, linearly

Most methods were named so that they are easy to understand what they are doing, ease of reference.
